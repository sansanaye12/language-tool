		<p>Q: What other encodings are commonly used for the Myanmar language?<br>

A: There are several ad hoc font encodings in common use, all needing specific fonts to render text. 
ZawgyiOne, Zawgyi 2008, and Myazedi are most commonly used.<br><br>

Q1: My friends all use Zawgyi in email and texting, but my device only supports Unicode.
How can I communicate with them?<br>

A: This is complicated, primarily because fonts cannot be added or changed on most mobile devices. 
   Free Myanmar Unicode keyboards are available for most mobile devices from online sources,
   so work with your friends to agree on a common way to communicate.

   Apps that convert between Zawgyi and Unicode are also available. 
   Copying and pasting text messages into such an interactive converter will let
   you read any message. i 2008, and Myazedi are most commonly used. <br><br>


   Q2: Do I need an input method editor (IME) to properly enter Myanmar text in Unicode?<br>

A: The keyboard arrangement does not determine if the text is Unicode or another form. 
   Keyboard applications that produce Unicode are available on most devices and web apps. 
   Some browsers support extensions that provide virtual keyboards for Myanmar and other 
   scripts. <br><br>

   Q3: Is the keyboard arrangement for Unicode different from other fonts?<br>

A: Unicode does not specify a keyboard arrangement, but leaves the keyboard or IME provider free to arrange
     the keyboard in the most natural way for the users. However, a Unicode font requires many fewer keys, 
     because only one code point is needed for each diacritic.<br><br>

     Q4: I want to read content that includes both Unicode and Zawgyi text. Can I do this?<br>

A: This is difficult because it requires either converting the Zawgyi text to Unicode, then displaying 
     with a Unicode-compliant font or wrapping each part of the text in some code that will apply an appropriate font.
     If possible, contact the source of the text and encourage them to provide it in Unicode form. <br><br>

     Q5: I am using a Unicode-compliant font on Unicode text. However, some characters are rendered incorrectly. What is wrong?<br>

A: Some rendering engines may not properly render with all Unicode fonts. Make sure the font and rendering software are compatible.
In some cases, changing to a different Unicode-compliant font may fix the problem. The Display Problems page has some general help that may be useful.

Another possibility is that the Unicode text is malformed, that is, the code points are incorrectly ordered. <br><br>

Q6: Will everyone in Myanmar eventually convert to Unicode?<br>

A: The Unicode standard was designed to provide consistent and efficient interchange of all textual information. Currently, much Myanmar-language text online still uses font encoding.
     However, Unicode's benefits for the Myanmar language itself, as well as the enabling of non-Myanmar languages, are expected to make Unicode the only way to represent Myanmar script.
     This is the trend followed for all other scripts supported by Unicode. <br><br>

     Q7: I have specific questions about other languages written with the Myanmar script, for example, Pali, Sanskrit, Shan, Mon, Karen, Kayah, and so on. Where can I learn more?<br>

A: The Unicode Standard includes characters to support other languages written with this writing system. To create text, specific keyboards that have the characters for the language may be required,
     because a standard Burmese keyboard does not have all the characters for Shan, Mon, Karen, and so on. These may be available as web applications and as soft keyboards on mobile devices.
     Unicode-compliant fonts should have the full range of characters in all three Myanmar code blocks.<br><br>

     Q8: How do I put a virama in my text?<br>

     A: Unicode's virama code point is U+1039. This can be entered with an appropriate keyboard. <br><br>

     Q9: What about collation of Myanmar language data? Is that just a binary sort?<br>

     A: Generally, a binary sort is not recommended. Instead, use Unicode Collation. The collation chart for Myanmar is here. <br><br>

     Q10 : Is the keyboard arrangement for Unicode different from other fonts?<br>

A: Unicode does not specify a keyboard arrangement, but leaves the keyboard or IME provider free to arrange the keyboard in the most natural way for the users.
However, a Unicode font requires many fewer keys, because only one code point is needed for each diacritic. <br><br>

Q11: How is Myanmar handled on mobile devices?<br>

A: Most mobile devices do not allow the user to change or replace the installed fonts. An application may "bundle" a font, but that will only be used within the application, not for other tools or apps.

    Many devices already include a Unicode-compliant font that is used by default for any Myanmar text. Any Unicode text will appear correctly in the system-installed applications. Zawgyi text will look wrong unless the particular application has included the Zawgyi font within the application.

    Some device vendors have installed ZawgyiOne in place of a Unicode font. In this case, Zawgyi will look right, but Unicode text in messages and web sites will look wrong.

    It is also possible for an application or device to detect and convert text to match the installed fonts.<br><br>

    Q12: How many people are using winInnwa?<br>
    A :  According to some market surveys, more than 90% of serious users use Win Myanmar Systems, while only about 65% of non-serious users and home-users uses them. As it is the only system common in all governmental organizations, the use of it has spread worldwide.<br><br>
   

    Q13: How much is winInnwa? I'm interested.<br>
     
A : Yes, there are currently 2 packages we offer:
         -WinMyanmar Office: US$ 10+Postage
          -10 fonts
          -keyboard driver for typing all patsint characters
